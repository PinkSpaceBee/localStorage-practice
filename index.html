            <h2>First garden</h2>
            <p>This is the tiniest garden, and it can only fit in a single plant. Also, the keeper of this garden is really fond of tulips and refuses to grow any other plant here. You can store a single string with a predetermined value in the localStorage here, and you can also remove it if you want to.</p>
            <button id="g1-add-btn">plant a tulip</button>
            <button id="g1-rm-btn">remove a tulip</button>
        </div>
            <div id="garden-2">
            <h2>Second garden</h2>
            <p>This garden is just as tiny as the previous one, but at least a local keeper isn't so unyielding and allows you to decide what plant to grow here. The rules are basically the same, but this time you get to type in what plant will be stored in the localStorage. And you can change it at any moment!</p>
            <p>Type in what plant do you want to store here:</p>
            <input type="text" id="g2-input" placeholder="daffodils are nice, aren't they?">
            <button id="g2-add-btn">add a plant</button>
            <button id="g2-rm-btn">remove a plant</button>

        <div id="garden-3">
            <h2>Third garden</h2>
            <p>New garden, new rules, baby! Here you can keep as many plants as you want, the place is enormous - but be careful: all plants must be the same. Just imagine a delightful garden full of crimson roses! Of course, if you get tired of roses, you can always grow something different. Cacti, anyone?</p>
            <p>Type in what plant and how many of them do you want to store here:</p>
            <input type="text" id="g3-text-input" placeholder="who doesn't love roses?">
            <input type="number" id="g3-num-input" placeholder="">
            <button id="g3-add-btn">add a plant</button>
            <button id="g3-rm-btn">remove a plant</button>

        <div id="garden-4">
            <h2>Fourth garden</h2>
            <p>And last but not least, the fourth garden! Here you may grow as many different plants as you want, and as many as you want! This garden stores an array of objects in the localStorage.</p>
            <p>Type in what plant and how many of them do you want to store here:</p>
