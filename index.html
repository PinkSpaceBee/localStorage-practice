            <h2>First garden</h2>
            <p>This is the tiniest garden, and it can only fit in a single plant. Also, the keeper of this garden is really fond of tulips and refuses to grow any other plant here. You can store a single string with a predetermined value in the localStorage here, and you can also remove it if you want to.</p>
            <button id="g1-add-btn">plant a tulip</button>
            <button id="g1-rm-btn">remove a tulip</button>

            <h2>Second garden</h2>
            <p>This garden is just as tiny as the previous one, but at least a local keeper isn't so unyielding and allows you to decide what plant to grow here. The rules are basically the same, but this time you get to type in what plant will be stored in the localStorage. And you can change it at any moment!</p>
            <p>Type in what plant do you want to store here:</p>
