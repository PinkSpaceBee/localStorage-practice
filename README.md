I'm learning how to use localStorage, and this project is a way to practice it. The project consists of four parts, the first one is being the easiest (storing a single string in localStorage), and the last being the most challenging (storing a dynamic array of objects in localStorage). I had great fun making it! But still, I've got a long way to go :)

TO FIX: 

1, YELLOW: Fourth garden div appends an empty div even if no plants were added, and because of this the G4 div has a lot of empty space at the bottom
