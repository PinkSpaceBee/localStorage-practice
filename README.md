I'm learning how to use localStorage, and this project is a way to practice it. 

The project consists of four parts, the first one is being the easiest (storing a single string in localStorage), and the last being the most challenging (storing a dynamic array of objects in localStorage).

Also, I tried following the mobile first principle, and gosh, is it convenient! I mean, I knew that this is a preferable way to do things, but I never thought it is actually makes styling easier.

I had great fun making it! But still, I've got a long way to go :)
